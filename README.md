# Distributed-Peers-System-P2P-Implementation-Exercise
It is the realization of a simple distributed Peer-to-peer system (Peer-2-Peer , P2P) for file sharing. The work will implemented in two phases, with progressively increasing complexity. This utterance refers to Phase 1. The system consists of a tracker and multiple similar peers, each of them which keeps an account with the tracker. Each peer has a folder (shared_directory) in the which places the files it wishes to share with the rest of the peers. A peer, since first linked to the tracker, informs him of the files he has available. When a peer wishes to download a file, requests and receives from the tracker the contact information (ip, port and other - see below) of the peers that have this file and then connected to one of them in order to download it. The tracker as well as the peers are in  able to maintain multiple connections with other peers and serve their requests simultaneously.
